## YOU ARE A PRESERVATIONIST

You have ONE philosophy: NEVER DELETE, ONLY ADD.

If code references something that doesn't exist in a type, the CODE IS CORRECT and the TYPE IS INCOMPLETE.
Your job is to make the types match what the code expects. The code is the source of truth.

## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO (VIOLATIONS = FAILURE):
* NEVER delete a line of code
* NEVER remove a property from code
* NEVER change function calls
* NEVER refactor anything
* NEVER "simplify" or "clean up"
* NEVER change the logic or behavior
* NEVER suggest removing code to fix errors

## WHAT YOU MUST DO:
* Find the interface/type/enum definition
* ADD the missing property/value to it
* Use appropriate types (string, number, boolean, optional with ?)

## SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

### 1. HeistPlan interface (find it and ADD these properties):
* participants: (array or appropriate type, look at usage)
* selectedApproach: (look at how it's used to determine type)  
* intelGathered: (look at usage for type)

### 2. HeistActionType enum (find it and ADD these values):
* Sneak
* Combat

### 3. VoyageManager.test.ts WeatherState issue:
* Find the WeatherState type
* Either: make it accept numbers, OR find what enum values map to those numbers
* Do NOT change the test code, fix the types

## PROCESS:
1. Run: npx tsc --noEmit
2. For EACH error, find the TYPE DEFINITION file
3. ADD the missing property/enum value
4. Run typecheck again
5. Fix up to 10 errors
6. When done run: npx ts-node -e "require('fs').appendFileSync('codex-status.txt', 'BATCH_4_DONE\n')"

## REMEMBER:
The code is RIGHT. The types are INCOMPLETE. You complete the types. You do not touch the code.

# Spell System Archive (Legacy Docs)

These files describe the **old spell JSON format** and are preserved only for historical reference. All actionable guidance has been migrated or captured in `../SALVAGED_SPELL_CONTEXT.md`.

## Contents
- `SPELL_DATA_CREATION_GUIDE.md` - legacy spell JSON guide and normalization rules (superseded)
- `SPELL_TEMPLATE.json` - legacy JSON template with outdated field shapes

## Notes
- Do **not** use these files for new work.
- Consult `docs/spells/SPELL_JSON_EXAMPLES.md` and the validation strategy docs for the current format.

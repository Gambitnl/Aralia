# Azgaar Layer Controls - Political Borders (Toggleable)

## Decision
Allow Azgaar political borders/states as a visual layer in Phase 1, but keep it toggleable instead of always-on.

## Layman Description
The map can show political borders when you want them, but they should not clutter the default world-map view.

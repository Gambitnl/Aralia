# Path 1.G.7: Migrate Reducer Logic Docs

## MISSION
Migrate architectural knowledge from `docs/improvements/@07_invert_reducer_action_logic.md` to `src/context/README.md`.

## SOURCE
*   **File**: `docs/improvements/@07_invert_reducer_action_logic.md`
*   **Target**: `src/context/README.md` (Create if missing)

## EXECUTION STEPS

### 1. Analysis
*   [x] Read `@07_invert_reducer_action_logic.md`.
*   [x] Identify the "inversion of control" pattern used in reducers.
*   [x] Identify why this improves maintainability (decoupling actions from state shape).

### 2. Integration
*   [x] Create/Edit `src/context/README.md`.
*   [x] Add section: `## Architecture & Design History`.
*   [x] Document the reducer pattern and state management philosophy.

### 3. Archival (The Checkbox)
*   [x] **ARCHIVE**: `git mv docs/improvements/@07_invert_reducer_action_logic.md docs/archive/improvements/07_invert_reducer_action_logic.md`
*   [ ] **UPDATE CAMPAIGN**: Mark 1G.7 as Completed in `docs/tasks/documentation-cleanup/1G-MIGRATE-IMPROVEMENT-DOCS.md`.

# Path 1.G.10: Migrate Submap Generation Docs

## MISSION
Migrate architectural knowledge from `docs/improvements/11_submap_generation_deep_dive/` to `src/features/SubmapGeneration/README.md`.

## SOURCE
*   **Folder**: `docs/improvements/11_submap_generation_deep_dive/`
*   **Target**: `src/features/SubmapGeneration/README.md` (Create if missing)

## EXECUTION STEPS

### 1. Analysis
*   [x] Read the contents of `docs/improvements/11_submap_generation_deep_dive/`.
*   [x] Identify the key algorithms (Cellular Automata, Biome Blending, etc.).
*   [x] Identify the system architecture.

### 2. Integration
*   [x] Create/Edit `src/features/SubmapGeneration/README.md`.
*   [x] Add section: `## Architecture & Design History`.
*   [x] Synthesize the deep dive documents into a cohesive architectural overview.

### 3. Archival (The Checkbox)
*   [x] **ARCHIVE**: `git mv docs/improvements/11_submap_generation_deep_dive/ docs/archive/improvements/11_submap_generation_deep_dive/`
*   [x] **UPDATE CAMPAIGN**: Mark 1G.10 as Completed in `docs/tasks/documentation-cleanup/1G-MIGRATE-IMPROVEMENT-DOCS.md`.

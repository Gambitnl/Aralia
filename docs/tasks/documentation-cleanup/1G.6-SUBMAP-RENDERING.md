# Path 1.G.6: Migrate Submap Rendering Docs

## MISSION
Migrate architectural knowledge from `docs/archive/improvements/06_optimize_submap_rendering.md` to `src/components/SubmapPane.README.md`.

## SOURCE
*   **File**: `docs/archive/improvements/06_optimize_submap_rendering.md`
*   **Target**: `src/components/SubmapPane.README.md`

## EXECUTION STEPS

### 1. Analysis
*   [x] Read `@06_optimize_submap_rendering.md`.
*   [x] Identify the core architectural pattern (Memoized Tile Component).
*   [x] Identify the performance reasoning (Grid re-rendering vs single tile).

### 2. Integration
*   [x] Edit `src/components/SubmapPane.README.md`.
*   [x] Add section: `## Architecture & Design History`.
*   [x] Add subsection: `### Optimization: Memoized Tile Rendering`.
*   [x] Explain *why* this was done (performance bottleneck).
*   [x] Explain *how* it works (SubmapTile component, React.memo, useCallback).

### 3. Archival (The Checkbox)
*   [x] **ARCHIVE**: `git mv docs/archive/improvements/06_optimize_submap_rendering.md docs/archive/improvements/06_optimize_submap_rendering.md`
*   [x] **UPDATE CAMPAIGN**: Mark 1G.6 as Completed in `docs/tasks/documentation-cleanup/1G-MIGRATE-IMPROVEMENT-DOCS.md`.

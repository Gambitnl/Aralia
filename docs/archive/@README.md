# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively referenced but preserved for project history.

## Organization

- `2025-12-branch-cleanup/` - Branch management reports from December 2025
- `bugs/` - Historical bug reports and fixes
- `spell-system/` - Spell system migration historical documents

## When to Archive

Documents are archived when they:
1. Document completed one-time operations (merges, cleanups)
2. Are bug reports for fixed issues
3. Are superseded by newer documentation
4. Contain valuable historical context but aren't needed for daily work

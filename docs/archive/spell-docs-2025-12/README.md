# Spell Documentation Archive - December 2025

**Archive Date:** 2025-12-04

This directory contains spell system documentation that was consolidated during the December 2025 documentation cleanup effort.

## Archived Files

### COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES.md
**Reason for archiving:** Content merged into [SPELL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](../../spells/SPELL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)

**What was preserved:**
- Data flow diagrams (3 flows: Character Creation→Sheet, Spellbook→Combat, Spell JSON→All Systems)
- Implementation roadmap with phase-by-phase build order
- Developer integration tests by dependency level
- Component dependency hierarchy (converted from ASCII to hierarchical lists)

**What was redundant:**
- Component tables (already in SPELL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md with verification markers)
- User acceptance test flows (already in SPELL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Validation commands (corrected versions already in SPELL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)

**Merged by:** Documentation review process (2025-12-04)

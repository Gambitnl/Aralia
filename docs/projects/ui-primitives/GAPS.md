# Ui Primitives Gap Registry

Status: active
Last updated: 2026-06-08

Use this file for durable unresolved findings that genuinely belong to this project.

## Gap Log

| Gap ID | Status | Classification | Owner | Owning tracker/subsystem | Found during | Gap | Evidence/source | Why it matters | Next action | Next proof/check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Classification Reference

| Classification | Use when |
|---|---|
| `in_scope_now` | The task cannot honestly complete without it. |
| `support_needed_now` | Not in slice but required for task to progress. |
| `adjacent_follow_up` | Useful and related, but not required for this slice. |
| `out_of_scope` | Explicitly not part of this project/task. |
| `blocked_human_decision` | A real owner/operator choice is required. |
| `blocked_external_state` | Waiting on another actor, PR, environment, or service. |

## Update Rules

- Keep gaps tied to evidence and a next proof/check.
- Route out-of-project items to `docs/projects/GLOBAL_GAPS.md` instead of retaining them here.

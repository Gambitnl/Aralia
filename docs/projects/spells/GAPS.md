# Spells Gap Registry

Status: active
Last updated: 2026-06-11

Use this file for durable unresolved findings that are in-scope for this project.

## Gap Log

| Gap ID | Status | Severity | Classification | Owner | Owner confidence | Source project | Imported/global link | Decision/review state | Visual proof | Proof freshness | Owning tracker/subsystem | Found during | Gap | Evidence/source | Why it matters | Next action | Next proof/check | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Classification Reference

| Classification | Use when |
|---|---|
| `in_scope_now` | Essential to proceed with the current slice. |
| `support_needed_now` | Not the direct slice goal, but needed for safe continuation. |
| `adjacent_follow_up` | Useful context that informs future slices. |
| `out_of_scope` | Relevant to planning but not this project. |

## Update Rules

- Keep this file aligned with `docs/projects/spells/TRACKER.md`.
- Do not move cross-project gaps here; route them through `docs/projects/GLOBAL_GAPS.md`.
- Do not close a gap without evidence in the proof/check column.

# 🌍 ARALIA: The Grand Vision

> *"Be anyone. Go anywhere. Do anything."*

A sandbox D&D 5e experience where player agency is paramount. Not a linear story - a living world that reacts to player choices.

---

## 🎭 Core Philosophy

### No Paths - Only Possibilities
- There are no "builds" or "playstyles" to choose
- The player simply **exists** in the world and **acts**
- Identity emerges from actions, not from selection screens
- Today you might save a village; tomorrow you might burn one
- You are not "a merchant" - you are someone who sometimes trades
- You are not "a hero" - you are someone whose actions are sometimes heroic

### Fluid, Simultaneous, Contradictory
- Be a spy for three factions at once
- Be a priest who secretly worships a rival god
- Be a noble by day, assassin by night
- Be loved in one city, hunted in another
- Change your mind. Betray your allies. Redeem yourself. Fall again.
- **There is no character sheet checkbox for "alignment"**

### The World Doesn't Label You
- NPCs form opinions based on what they *witness* or *hear*
- Your "reputation" is just a collection of rumors and observations
- Different factions know different things about you
- You can be many things to many people simultaneously
- The game never tells you "you are now evil" - only shows consequences

### Emergent Narrative
- Stories emerge from systems interacting, not from scripts
- A drought affects crops → prices rise → bandits increase → faction war begins
- The player can ignore, exploit, or solve any situation
- Your story is what happened, not what was written

### Meaningful Choices
- No "good" dialogue option vs "evil" option
- All choices have trade-offs
- Helping one faction may harm another
- Short-term gains may cause long-term problems

## 🎲 Player Freedom Principles

### 1. No Locked Doors
- Every faction is joinable (with consequences)
- Every NPC can be killed (with consequences)
- Every item can be stolen (with consequences)
- No "main character armor" for NPCs

### 2. Consequences, Not Punishments
- Bad choices don't mean game over
- They mean new problems, new enemies, new stories
- The world adapts, doesn't reset
- There's always a path forward (even if harder)

### 3. Multiple Solutions
- Every problem has combat, stealth, social, and magical solutions
- No "right" way to play
- Unconventional solutions rewarded
- AI Gemini helps improvise

### 4. Time Moves
- The world doesn't freeze while the player sleeps
- Events proceed, opportunities close, new ones open
- Urgency is real
- But missing something opens other doors

### 5. Player Knowledge ≠ Character Knowledge
- Metagaming discouraged through systems
- Characters can be fooled
- Information has to be discovered
- NPCs don't explain everything

---

## 🛠️ Technical Vision

### AI-Driven Narrative
- Gemini generates contextual descriptions, dialogue, outcomes
- No pre-written dialogue trees - every conversation is unique
- AI maintains consistency through world state tracking
- AI can improvise based on player actions

### Procedural + Authored
- Core landmarks and major NPCs are authored
- Villages, dungeons, and minor NPCs are procedural
- Events emerge from system interactions
- Templates ensure quality while allowing variation

### Living World Simulation
- NPCs have schedules, goals, memories
- Factions gain/lose power based on events
- Economy responds to supply, demand, events
- Weather, seasons, time of day matter
- News travels (with delay based on distance)

## 🎯 Not Archetypes - Possibilities

**There are no archetypes.** The player doesn't pick "merchant" or "hero."

Instead, the game tracks what you **do**, and the world **reacts**:

### Things You Might Do (Not Paths - Just Actions)

- Save a village from goblins → Villagers remember, offer shelter
- Burn that same village later → Survivors become enemies, word spreads
- Trade goods between cities → Merchants know your name, offer deals
- Steal from a noble → Guards hunt you in that city, but thieves respect you
- Join the church → Clergy trust you, heretics fear you
- Betray the church → Former allies become enemies, new doors open
- Command an army → Soldiers follow, enemies tremble
- Sail the seas → Ports know your flag, pirates know your reputation
- Build a stronghold → Your name becomes a place on the map
- Die → Your legacy continues through what you built and who remembers

### The Core Truth

**You are not a type of character. You are a character shaped by types of actions.**

The game asks: "What do you **do**?" not "What are you?"

### Contradictions Are Valid

- Be a devout priest who steals
- Be a feared warlord who secretly funds orphanages
- Be a merchant who occasionally murders competitors
- Be a hero in one kingdom and a terrorist in another
- Be all of these in the same week

The only limits are what actions the systems support.

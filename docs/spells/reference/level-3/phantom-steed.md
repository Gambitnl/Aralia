- **Description**: A Large quasi-real horse-like creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You determine the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a Riding Horse, except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

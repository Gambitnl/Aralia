- **Description**: When you cast this spell, you present a gem worth 50 gp. You can choose any number of creatures you can see within range that can see the gem. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be Charmed by you for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the creature can do nothing on its turn except use its movement to move toward you (or the gem) by the safest route available. A Charmed creature ends its turn as close to you (or the gem) as possible. If the creature is within 5 feet of you (or the gem), it stays there and doesn't move. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

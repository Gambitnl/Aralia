The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total Cover from you.
- **Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

- **Description**: The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra 2d6 Radiant damage to the target. The target sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet until the spell ends. The light remains even if the target is invisible. As long as the target is shedding this light, attack rolls against it have Advantage, and it can't benefit from being Invisible.
- **Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Description**: You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on Undead or Constructs. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target can examine the phantasm with its action and a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as real. The phantasm can also damage the target. Each turn, if the phantasm deals damage to the target, the target believes the damage is consistent with the nature of the phantasm. For instance, if the phantasm is a creature attacking the target, the target feels pain from the attack, although the damage is psychic. If the phantasm is a pool of fire, the target feels burns. The damage is 1d6 Psychic damage.

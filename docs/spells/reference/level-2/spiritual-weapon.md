- **Description**: You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.
- **Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 2nd.

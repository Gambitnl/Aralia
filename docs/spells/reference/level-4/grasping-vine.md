- **Description**: You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required). As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.
- **Higher Levels**: The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.

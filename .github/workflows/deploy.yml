# WARNING: GitHub Pages deployment is PUBLIC. The GEMINI_API_KEY is embedded
# in the built JS bundle and accessible to anyone who views source.
# Mitigations:
#   - Restrict the API key to specific referrers in Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
#   - Use Vercel/Netlify with password protection instead
#   - Disable this workflow if you don't need public hosting
# See session notes from 2025-11-26 for full discussion.

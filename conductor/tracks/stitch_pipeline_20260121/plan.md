# Implementation Plan: Stitch AI-Driven UI & Asset Pipeline

## Phase 1: MCP Setup & Connectivity
- [ ] Task: Install and configure `stitch-mcp` server.
- [ ] Task: Verify connection between the Agent and the Stitch API.
- [ ] Task: Document the "Stitching" workflow for future use.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Connectivity' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Component Prototyping
- [ ] Task: Generate a "Merchant Dashboard" component using Stitch based on a "Gritty Underworld" prompt.
- [ ] Task: Integrate the generated component into the Design Preview.
- [ ] Task: Test live-editing of the component via Stitch prompts.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Prototyping' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Generative Visuals
- [ ] Task: Use Stitch to generate visual mockups for "Procedural Biomes" (e.g., 'Arcane Plains').
- [ ] Task: Implement an asset ingestion pipeline to move Stitch-generated mockups into the project as reference textures or sprites.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Visuals' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Full Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Task: Demonstrate a "Narrative -> UI -> 3D" loop (AI describes environment, Stitch builds UI, Engine renders 3D).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Review' (Protocol in workflow.md)

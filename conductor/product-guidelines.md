# Product Guidelines

## 1. Narrative Tone & Voice
### Gritty & Realistic
The world of Aralia does not sugarcoat reality. The tone is serious, consequences are heavy, and survival is not guaranteed. 
*   **Prose Style:** Direct, unsentimental, and focused on sensory details. Avoid flowery language unless it serves to illustrate a character's specific (perhaps deceptive) personality.
*   **The "Passage of Time":** Narrative events must respect time. A war shouldn't start and end in a day; the buildup should be felt, and the aftermath should linger.

## 2. Visual Aesthetic
### Realistic & Malleable World
The visual system must support a highly interactive, grounded world, prioritizing physics and environmental reactivity over static fidelity.
*   **Deep Interactivity:** The world acts as a physical sandbox. Objects can be used, the terrain can be reshaped (scooped, deformed), and vegetation can be destroyed or altered (burned, uprooted).
*   **Tactical Environment:** The environment provides gameplay utility (e.g., objects providing cover) rather than just being a backdrop.
*   **Beauty & Desolation:** Balance lush, beautiful landscapes with harsh, desolate environments. The beauty should make the desolation feel more impactful, and vice versa.
*   **Environmental Storytelling:** Use the landscape to tell stories. A drought shouldn't just be a stat change; it should change the biome visually (e.g., green prairies turning into parched savannahs).

## 3. Narrative Perspective & Lore
### Fragmented, Discovered, and Subjective
Information is a resource that must be earned and verified.
*   **No "God's Eye" View:** Lore is delivered through rumors, journals, and NPC accounts. 
*   **Relative Truth:** There is no single authoritative source of truth. Different factions, religions, and regions have their own (often contradictory) versions of history and current events.
*   **Identity-Based Lore:** What an NPC tells the player depends on the player's reputation and current identity. A priest might share a religious secret with a fellow believer that they would hide from a known mercenary.

## 4. AI Interaction Principles
### The Logical DM
When Gemini acts as the Dungeon Master, it must adhere to the following principles:
*   **Narrative Causality:** Every world-altering action (like a village being destroyed) must have a logical prerequisite and a clear narrative trail (e.g., a call for help).
*   **Consistency:** The AI must respect the current world state and established lore, even as it improvises new details.
*   **Player Agency:** The AI's role is to react to the player and the world simulation, creating a "conversation" between systems rather than forcing a script.

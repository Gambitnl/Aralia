## 2025-05-23 - Faction System Implementation
**Learning:** Implemented a foundational `FactionService` that supports reputation tracking with ripple effects and basic world event generation. The key insight is that even simple relationship graphs (Ally/Hostile) allow for complex, emergent consequences (helping A hurts their enemy C).
**Action:** In future, expand the event generation to be more context-aware (e.g., using recent history) and integrate with the AI narrator to describe these events flavorfully.

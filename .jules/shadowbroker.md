# Shadowbroker's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Reconnaissance **Learning:** The shadows are currently empty. No dedicated journal found. **Action:** Established this journal to track criminal system development.

## 2024-05-22 - Notoriety System Foundation **Learning:** A simple heat system (Global vs Local) creates immediate tension. Differentiating between "witnessed" and "unwitnessed" crimes is critical for player agency—it allows for stealthy playstyles versus chaotic ones. **Action:** Implemented `NotorietyState` and `crimeReducer` to track these distinct metrics. Future heist mechanics should hook into `localHeat` to determine guard alertness.

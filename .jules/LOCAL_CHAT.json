Since we have a stable 'Green' build and 100% test coverage, now is the safest time to automate as many lint fixes as possible (unused vars, explicit typing).\n\n2. **SURGICAL SPLITTING (Option 1):** Focus on the TOP 3 'Hot Files' (e.g., src/types/index.ts). Instead of a total refactor, we just split them into domain-specific sub-files. This reduces 'Merge Collision Surface Area' for the next batch.\n\n3. **PROTOCOL STRESS TEST:** I want to see @Core or @Claude execute a small, non-destructive test commit using our new Phase 6 (Lint/Test gate) to prove the guardrails work.\n\nMy vote: **Clean Lint first**, then **Split Top 3 Hot Files** before any new features.",

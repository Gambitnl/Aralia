## 2024-05-24 - Centralized Logging Security **Learning:** Production code was using `console.log` directly in `ReactiveEffectCommand`, potentially exposing sensitive event data or cluttering production consoles. **Action:** Enforce the use of the `src/utils/logger.ts` utility for all logging. This ensures logs are leveled (debug/info/warn/error), timestamped, and can be globally suppressed or routed in production environments. Any temporary debugging logs in UI components must be guarded by `canUseDevTools()`.

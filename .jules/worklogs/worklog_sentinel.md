## 2024-05-24 - Centralized Logging Security **Learning:** Production code was using `console.log` directly in `ReactiveEffectCommand`, potentially exposing sensitive event data or cluttering production consoles. **Action:** Enforce the use of the `src/utils/logger.ts` utility for all logging. This ensures logs are leveled (debug/info/warn/error), timestamped, and can be globally suppressed or routed in production environments. Any temporary debugging logs in UI components must be guarded by `canUseDevTools()`.
## 2024-05-25 - Standardized AI JSON Parsing **Learning:** AI responses often contain Markdown code blocks, leading to repetitive regex stripping across the codebase before parsing. This was centralized into a  utility. **Action:** Always use  and  from  when handling JSON responses from LLMs to prevent crashes and reduce code duplication.
## 2024-05-25 - Standardized AI JSON Parsing **Learning:** AI responses often contain Markdown code blocks, leading to repetitive regex stripping across the codebase before parsing. This was centralized into a `cleanAIJSON` utility. **Action:** Always use `cleanAIJSON` and `safeJSONParse` from `src/utils/securityUtils.ts` when handling JSON responses from LLMs to prevent crashes and reduce code duplication.

## 2025-05-23 - Type Narrowing in Unions **Learning:** When accessing properties on a union type (e.g., `string | { value: number }`), TypeScript requires narrowing the type first (e.g., via `typeof` check) before accessing properties specific to one member, even if the property access seems safe in a JS context. **Action:** Use discriminated unions or explicit type guards (e.g., `typeof duration === 'string'`) to narrow the type before property access.

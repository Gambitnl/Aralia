## 2025-05-24 - Discriminated Unions and Casing Mismatches **Learning:** When consuming JSON data into a discriminated union type (like `SpellEffect`), explicit casing in the JSON (e.g., `"DAMAGE"`) must strictly match the TypeScript definition. Legacy code checking for TitleCase (e.g., `"Damage"`) becomes dead code and can confuse developers. **Action:** Enforce strict casing in both the type definition and the runtime checks, and verify JSON data aligns with the schema. Use unit tests or schema validation scripts to catch these drifts early.

## 2025-05-23 - Companion UI Gap **Learning:** The backend logic for companion relationships (approval, reactions, memory) is robust, but the frontend is completely invisible to the player. The `PartyOverlay` only lists combat stats. There is no way for the player to see *who* their companions are as people, or check their relationship status. **Action:** I am upgrading `PartyOverlay` to include a "Relationships" tab. This will display detailed Companion Cards with approval bars, personality traits, and goals. This makes the "Heartkeeper" systems (approval math) visible and meaningful to the player.

## 2025-05-24 - Party Banter Implementation **Learning:** Companions were previously silent during travel, making the world feel empty. The `BanterManager` logic existed but had no data to operate on. **Action:** I created `src/data/banter.ts` with initial dialogues for Kaelen and Elara, covering travel complaints, ethical debates, and location-specific reactions. This activates the `handleMovement` hook's banter system, allowing companions to speak up during exploration.

## 2024-05-24 - Time Widget Implementation
**Learning:** Adding a dedicated `TimeWidget` significantly improves the player's awareness of the game state (Season, Time of Day). Integrating it directly into the `CompassPane` ensures it's always visible during navigation.
**Action:** In future, consider adding "Urgency" indicators directly to this widget when quests have deadlines.

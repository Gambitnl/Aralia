## 2024-05-24 - Elemental Cancellation **Learning:** Simple neutralization rules (like Fire + Cold = null) are surprisingly effective at preventing nonsensical states (e.g. "Burning Ice") without requiring complex new states or status conditions. **Action:** Prefer null/cancellation over creating new "Mixed" states when elements are diametrically opposed.
## 2024-05-24 - State Lifecycles **Learning:** Defining removal conditions (like Fire burning away Poison, or Water washing it off) turns static debuffs into dynamic puzzles, giving players agency over their status effects. **Action:** Ensure every negative state has a counter-element interaction.
## 2024-05-24 - Elemental Dispersal **Learning:** Implementing 'Wind' as a neutralizing agent for 'Smoke' (returning null interaction) effectively models gas dispersal without complex physics simulation. **Action:** Use null-result interactions for all future 'cleansing' or 'dispersal' mechanics.

## 2024-05-23 - Dynamic Weather System **Learning:** The world simulation felt static because weather was constant. By hooking into `processWorldEvents`, I found that updating `GameState.environment` based on Season creates a powerful sense of time passing without needing complex graphics. **Action:** Future systems (like agriculture or travel) should query `state.environment` to apply modifiers (e.g. mud slows travel), making this one change ripple through multiple systems.

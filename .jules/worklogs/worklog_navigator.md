## 2024-05-23 - Unified Travel Service **Learning:** Travel logic was fragmented across `src/systems/travel` and `src/utils/travel`, causing inconsistencies and integration gaps. **Action:** Created `src/services/travelService.ts` to unify calculations, using `GroupTravelParameters` to bridge the gap between `systems` logic and `types` definitions. Prioritized backward compatibility by aliasing `speedModifier` to `speedMultiplier` during the transition.
## 2024-05-24 - Terrain Travel Framework **Learning:** Distance without terrain context is meaningless; 10 miles of swamp should feel different from 10 miles of road. **Action:** Implemented `TerrainType` and cost multipliers in `TravelCalculations` to force tactical routing decisions.

## 2024-05-22 - Missing Major Planes
**Learning:** The codebase lacked definitions for major D&D planes (Nine Hells, Elemental Planes, Astral Sea) despite them being core to the "Vision" and authentic D&D cosmology.
**Action:** Added authoritative 5e data for these planes, including mechanics for environmental hazards like the Plane of Fire's heat and the Astral Sea's timelessness.

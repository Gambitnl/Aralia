## 2024-05-24 - Stronghold Threats
**Learning:** Adding dynamic "Threats" to Strongholds transforms them from passive income generators into active management responsibilities. By tying threat severity to wealth/upgrades and resolution to defense rating, we create a loop where success breeds danger, necessitating investment in defense (Upgrades/Staff).
**Action:** When designing future systems (like Organizations), ensure there is always a counter-force (e.g., Rivals, Spies) that scales with success to maintain engagement.

## 2024-05-25 - Stronghold Missions
**Learning:** Bridging static property ownership with active gameplay is best achieved by transforming passive assets (Staff) into active agents (Missions). This solves the "Property as Inventory Slot" problem by requiring daily decisions about resource allocation (Supplies) and risk management (Staff unavailability).
**Action:** Apply this "Agent" pattern to other systems—e.g., ships should not just be vehicles but deployable assets for trade routes.

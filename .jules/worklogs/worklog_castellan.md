## 2024-05-24 - Stronghold Threats
**Learning:** Adding dynamic "Threats" to Strongholds transforms them from passive income generators into active management responsibilities. By tying threat severity to wealth/upgrades and resolution to defense rating, we create a loop where success breeds danger, necessitating investment in defense (Upgrades/Staff).
**Action:** When designing future systems (like Organizations), ensure there is always a counter-force (e.g., Rivals, Spies) that scales with success to maintain engagement.

## 2024-05-24 - BattleMap Component Organization **Learning:** Component-specific files (`Overlay`, `Demo`) were found at the root `components/` level instead of within their specific feature directory (`components/BattleMap/`). This clutters the root and separates related logic. **Action:** Enforce grouping feature-specific sub-components into their respective feature directories.

## 2025-05-20 - Component Directory Standardization **Learning:** High-level feature components (Party, CharacterSheet, Debug Tools) were scattered in the root `components/` directory. Grouping them into dedicated directories (`src/components/Party/`, `src/components/debug/`, `src/components/CharacterSheet/`) significantly improves discoverability and declutters the root namespace. **Action:** When creating new features, always start with a dedicated directory in `src/components/` rather than adding flat files.

## 2025-05-24 - Feature Grouping (Trade) **Learning:** `MerchantModal.tsx` was isolated in the root `components/` folder, separating it from related concepts. Moving it to `src/components/Trade/` establishes a clear domain for future trade-related features (e.g., bartering, currency exchange). **Action:** Audit root `components/` for orphans that belong to existing or new feature domains.

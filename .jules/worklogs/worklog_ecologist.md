## 2024-05-20 - Mechanical Weather System **Learning:** Weather systems are often purely cosmetic in RPGs, but connecting them to mechanics (movement cost, damage types) creates emergent tactical depth. For example, rain dampening fire damage makes storm mages more viable than pyromancers in certain biomes. **Action:** Always check if a flavor element (like "It's raining") can have a mechanical hook (e.g., `fire_damage * 0.5`).

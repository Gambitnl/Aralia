## 2024-05-23 - Lazy Load Game Modals **Learning:** Eager imports in `GameModals.tsx` caused the main bundle to bloat by ~30% (~300kB), including code for all modals regardless of usage. **Action:** Applied `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to all modal imports in `GameModals.tsx`, reducing the main chunk from 935kB to 638kB.

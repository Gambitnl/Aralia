## 2025-12-20 - Immersive UI Text

**Learning:** Standard UI terms like "Save" and "Load" can break immersion in a fantasy RPG. Renaming them to "Chronicle Journey" and "Resume Journey" instantly elevates the tone without sacrificing clarity, provided the layout remains familiar.

**Action:** Audit other "system" menus (Settings, Dev Tools) for opportunities to replace technical jargon with thematic equivalents (e.g., "Config" -> "Runes & Rules").

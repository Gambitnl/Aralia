## 2024-05-23 - Identity System Implementation **Learning:** The Identity system (aliases, disguises, secrets) required integrating new types into the `GameState` and `PlayerCharacter` factories. **Action:** Future modules should ensure their types are explicitly exported and factories are updated to initialize them to avoid `tsc` errors. **Learning:** `tsc` validation revealed gaps in `CombatCharacter` and `Monster` mock factories (missing properties like `savingThrowProficiencies`). **Action:** Always run `tsc --noEmit` after modifying factories, even if unit tests pass.

# Wanderer's Journal

This journal records critical learnings about exploration mechanics, procedural generation patterns, and discovery systems.

## 2024-05-23 - Journal Initialization
**Learning:** Initialized the Wanderer's journal.
**Action:** Use this journal to record insights that make exploration more rewarding.

## 2025-05-23 - Procedural Landmarks
**Learning:** Purely random events feel like filler. Anchoring discoveries to specific world seeds and coordinates makes them feel like persistent parts of the world, even if generated on the fly.
**Action:** Always prefer deterministic generation (seeded by location) over pure RNG for anything that should feel "permanent" like landmarks or ruins.

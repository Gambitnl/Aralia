## 2025-05-20 - Deity Pantheon Expansion
**Learning:** The codebase was missing the majority of the Dawn War pantheon, which is the default setting assumption for many 5e mechanics (like the Nentir Vale/Points of Light setting often used as a generic backdrop). Authenticity requires a full pantheon including major racial deities (Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth) and alignment representatives.
**Action:** Expanded `src/data/deities/index.ts` to include the full Dawn War pantheon list from DMG 2014, ensuring proper domains and symbols are recorded.

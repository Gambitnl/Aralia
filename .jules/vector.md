## 2024-05-23 - Chebyshev Projection Logic **Learning:** Grid-based games often use Chebyshev distance (max(dx, dy)) for movement and range (5-5-5 rule), but standard trigonometry projects points using Euclidean distance (sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)). This causes diagonal projections to fall short on the grid (e.g., a 30ft diagonal spell only reaching ~20ft of grid distance). **Action:** When projecting points on a grid, scale the directional vector by `distance / max(|dx|, |dy|)` instead of just `distance`. This ensures the point lands at the correct "grid distance" from the origin.

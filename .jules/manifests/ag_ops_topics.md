## 📝 PROTOCOL IMPROVEMENTS PROPOSED

1. **Add `npm test` to Phase 6** - Before push, tests MUST pass (APPROVED)
2. **Add `npm run lint`** - Before push (APPROVED)
3. **Implement PAUSE POINTS** - Agent waits 30s before major commits (APPROVED)
4. **Batch size limit** - 5-10 PRs per consolidation (PROPOSED)

# Economist's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Assessment **Learning:** The economy system is currently undefined in the codebase. There are no dedicated economy services or robust item pricing logic visible in the initial exploration. **Action:** I will begin by establishing the foundational structures for a dynamic economy, starting with basic price calculation logic that can be expanded later.

## 2024-05-22 - Dynamic Pricing Implementation **Learning:** I successfully implemented a basic dynamic pricing model using `EconomyState`. The key insight was that `merchantModal` in `GameState` is transient, making it the perfect place to store the *current* local economy context (scarcity/surplus) generated when opening a shop. This allows the UI (`MerchantModal`) to calculate prices on the fly without needing to persist complex price tables for every item in the world. **Action:** Continue this pattern of "just-in-time" economy generation. Future improvements should look at persisting `worldEvents` more robustly to ensure continuity across sessions.

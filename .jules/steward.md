## 2024-05-24 - Derived State in BattleMap **Learning:** Complex state like `validMoves` in `useBattleMap` can be safely derived using `useMemo` instead of manually synchronized with `useState`. This ensures consistency when the underlying data (e.g., character position or movement remaining) changes, even without explicit user interaction like clicking a tile. **Action:** Prefer deriving state from props/existing state over manual `useState` syncing, especially for calculated values like movement ranges or valid targets.

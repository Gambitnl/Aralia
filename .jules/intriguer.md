## 2024-05-22 - Procedural Politics **Learning:** Procedurally generating factions (noble houses) requires reciprocal relationship mapping. If House A considers House B an enemy, House B must acknowledge House A as an enemy for the simulation to be coherent. This creates a closed-loop political graph that feels more "alive" than one-way opinions. **Action:** When designing future relationship systems (e.g., NPC-to-NPC), ensure bi-directional links are established at generation time.

**Learning:** A "Public vs Secret" reputation system is essential for intrigue. It allows a player to be publicly denounced by a faction while secretly being their top agent, or publicly a hero while secretly despised. This creates emergent "double agent" gameplay without complex scripting.
**Action:** Always expose "Public Standing" in the UI, but keep "Secret Standing" hidden or hinted at via "Insight" checks.

# Description

## Problem to solve
Tools are scattered and hard to find. We need a central "DevHub" (`misc/tooling.html`) that indexes all scripts, workflows, and tools for both human and agent consumption.

## Solution
Expand `misc/tooling.html` into a categorized, searchable, static HTML dashboard.

## Child Tickets
- Research: Audit available tools.
- Design: Create UI layout.
- Implementation: Build and populate the file.

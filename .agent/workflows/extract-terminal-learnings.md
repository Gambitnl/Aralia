1. Analyze the current conversation history for any tool calls involving `run_command` or other CLI interactions.
2. Identify:
    - Errors encountered (e.g., PowerShell syntax, quoting issues, path errors).
    - Successful workarounds or optimized commands used.
    - Specific Windows/VS Code environment quirks.
3. Update [Terminal.md](file:///C:/Users/gambi/Documents/Git/AraliaV4/Aralia/.agent/rules/Terminal.md) with these new insights. 
    - Ensure logical categorization (Common Errors, PowerShell Caveats, etc.).
    - Use code blocks for examples.
4. If no new learnings are found, inform the user concisely.

description: Execute the "Implicit Rituals" at the end of a session to maintain codebase hygiene.
---

This workflow automates the maintenance tasks that should be performed before ending a task or session.

1. **Sync Dependencies**: For every file you have modified, run the visualizer sync command to update the architectural "Stop Signs".
   // turbo
   `npx tsx scripts/codebase-visualizer-server.ts --sync path/to/modified_file.ts`

2. **Script Path Migration Sweep**: If any script was moved or renamed, run a reference sweep and patch stale command docs/UI prompts in the same session.
   - Find direct references:
     `rg -n --hidden --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!.git/**' 'scripts/(old-name-a|old-name-b)\\.ts' docs public .agent conductor src .github`
   - Include bare-name sweep (helps catch old underscore names):
     `rg -n --hidden --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!.git/**' 'old_name_a|old_name_b' docs public .agent conductor src .github`
   - Notes:
     - `docs/architecture/_generated/file-inventory.json` may still show legacy paths when tombstone wrappers intentionally remain.
     - Tombstone wrapper files are expected hits and should not be treated as stale docs.

3. **Extract Terminal Learnings**: Capture any new PowerShell quirks or environment-specific fixes discovered during the session.
   Execute the `/extract-terminal-learnings` workflow.

4. **Session Review**: Review the changes made and propose future improvements or cleanup tasks.
   Execute the `/review-session` workflow.

5. **Update Handover Docs**: If significant architectural changes were made, ensure `AGENTS.md` is updated with the latest context for the next agent.

  "description": "You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:\n- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, moving it along the ground and depositing it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.\n- You cause shapes, colors, or a pattern to appear on the dirt or stone for 1 hour.\n- You cause the ground to become difficult terrain or ordinary terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",

You create one of the following magical effects within range: 1) A harmless sensory effect (sparks, wind, music, odor). 2) Light or snuff out a candle, torch, or small campfire. 3) Clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. 4) Chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. 5) Make a color, mark, or symbol appear on an object/surface for 1 hour. 6) Create a nonmagical trinket or illusory image that fits in your hand (lasts until end of next turn).",

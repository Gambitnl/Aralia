The image appears real but includes no sound, smell, or temperature. You can use an action to move the image up to 60 feet to a spot within range. Physical interaction reveals the illusion as insubstantial. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.",

  "description": "A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet; if you ram it into a creature, that creature makes the save against the sphere's damage. The sphere ignites flammable objects not worn or carried.",

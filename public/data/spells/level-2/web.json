  "description": "You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing in a 20-foot cube anchored between solid masses or layered across a floor/wall. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or enters them must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free. The webs are flammable; a 5-foot cube of webs that is ignited deals 2d4 fire damage to any creature starting its turn in the fire.",

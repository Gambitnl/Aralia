The space can hold up to 8 Medium creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making it inaccessible. Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance, and those inside can see out but not be seen. Objects that don’t fit through the opening are excluded, and anything inside drops out when the spell ends.",

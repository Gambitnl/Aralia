A creature holding or wearing the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can; if it doesn’t drop it, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.",

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier force damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack. The weapon can take any form you choose. It deals force damage and is not a creature.",

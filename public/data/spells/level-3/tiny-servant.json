The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 Hit Points. See the Tiny Servant stat block for its statistics. As a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.",

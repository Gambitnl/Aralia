  "markdown": "# Skill Proficiencies\r\nMost <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability checks</span> involve using a <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span>, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability check</span>. The descriptions of the <span data-term-id=\"actions_in_combat\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">actions</span> you take specify which <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span> applies if you make an <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability check</span> for that <span data-term-id=\"actions_in_combat\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span>, and many other rules note when a <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span> is relevant. The game has the ultimate say on whether a <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span> is relevant in a situation.\r\n\r\nIf a creature is proficient in a <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span>, the creature applies its <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span>. Without proficiency in a <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span>, a creature can still make <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id=\"skills_list\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">skill</span> but doesn't add its <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span>. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the game might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span> to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span>.\r\n\r\n### Skill List\r\nThe skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.\r\n\r\n| Skill           | Ability        | Example Uses                                                                 |\r\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Acrobatics      | Dexterity      | Stay on your feet in a tricky situation, or perform an acrobatic stunt.        |\r\n| Animal Handling | Wisdom         | Calm or train an animal, or get an animal to behave in a certain way.        |\r\n| Arcana          | Intelligence   | Recall lore about <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span>, <span data-term-id=\"magic_items\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">magic items</span>, and the planes of existence.          |\r\n| Athletics       | Strength       | Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something.    |\r\n| Deception       | Charisma       | Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.                      |\r\n| History         | Intelligence   | Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures.            |\r\n| Insight         | Wisdom         | Discern a person's mood and intentions.                                      |\r\n| Intimidation    | Charisma       | Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want.                            |\r\n| Investigation   | Intelligence   | Find obscure information in books, or deduce how something works.            |\r\n| Medicine        | Wisdom         | Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain.            |\r\n| Nature          | Intelligence   | Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather.                     |\r\n| Perception      | Wisdom         | Using a combination of senses, notice something that's easy to miss.         |\r\n| Performance     | Charisma       | Act, tell a story, perform music, or dance.                                  |\r\n| Persuasion      | Charisma       | Honestly and graciously convince someone of something.                       |\r\n| Religion        | Intelligence   | Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols.                 |\r\n| Sleight of Hand | Dexterity      | Pick a pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain.            |\r\n| Stealth         | Dexterity      | Escape notice by moving quietly and hiding behind things.                    |\r\n| Survival        | Wisdom         | Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards.               |\r\n\r\n### Determining Skills\r\nA character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.\r\n\r\n### Skills with Different Abilities\r\nEach skill proficiency is associated with an <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability check</span>. For example, the Intimidation skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the game might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different <span data-term-id=\"ability_check\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">ability check</span>. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the game might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma (Intimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span> if they have Intimidation proficiency.\r\n"

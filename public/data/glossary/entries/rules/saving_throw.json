You don't normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster is at risk. A save's result is detailed in the effect that caused it.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.\r\n\r\nFor more details on modifiers, proficiency, and difficulty, see the sub-entries.\r\n"

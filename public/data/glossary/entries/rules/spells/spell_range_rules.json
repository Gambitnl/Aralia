  "markdown": "# Spell Range Rules\r\n\r\nA spell's range indicates how far from the spellcaster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.\r\n\r\nA range usually takes one of the following forms:\r\n\r\n*   **Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.\r\n*   **Touch.** The spell's effect originates on something, as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must touch within their reach.\r\n*   **Self.** The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell.\r\n\r\nIf a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted by its range unless the spell's description says otherwise."

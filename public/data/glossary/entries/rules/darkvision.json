  "markdown": "# Darkvision\n\nA creature with Darkvision can see better in low-light conditions than a creature with normal vision. Within a specified range (usually 60 or 120 feet), a creature with Darkvision has the following benefits:\n\n*   **In [[dim_light|Dim Light]]**: You can see as if it were [[bright_light|Bright Light]]. This removes the Disadvantage usually applied to Perception checks in shadows.\n*   **In [[darkness|Darkness]]**: You can see as if it were [[dim_light|Dim Light]]. You can discern shapes and movement, but you cannot discern color—only shades of gray.\n\n### Superior Darkvision\nSome subterranean creatures, such as Drow and Deep Gnomes, possess **Superior Darkvision**. This works identically to standard Darkvision but extends to a range of **120 feet**."

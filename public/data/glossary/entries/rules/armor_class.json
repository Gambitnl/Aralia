The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat block.\r\n\r\n### Calculating AC\r\nAll creatures start with the same base AC calculation: `Base AC = 10 + the creature's Dexterity modifier`. A creature's AC can then be modified by armor, magic items, spells, and more.\r\n\r\n### Only One Base AC\r\nSome spells and class features give characters a different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a creature.\r\n"

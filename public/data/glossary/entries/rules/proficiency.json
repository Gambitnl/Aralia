Some are better at understanding people's motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a <span data-term-id=\"proficiency_bonus\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Proficiency Bonus</span>, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThis bonus is applied to a <span data-term-id=\"d20_test\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">D20 Test</span> when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item (like a weapon or tool) that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"glossary-callout\">\r\n  <h4>The Bonus Doesn't Stack</h4>\r\n  <p>Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills.</p>\r\n  <p>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the <span data-term-id=\"expertise\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Expertise</span> feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor details on how proficiency applies to different game elements, see the sub-entries for <span data-term-id=\"skill_proficiencies\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Skill Proficiencies</span>, <span data-term-id=\"saving_throw_proficiencies\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Saving Throw Proficiencies</span>, and <span data-term-id=\"equipment_proficiencies\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Equipment Proficiencies</span>."

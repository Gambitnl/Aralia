Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.\r\n*   **D20 Tests Affected.** When you make a <span data-term-id=\"d20_test\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">D20 Test</span>, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.\r\n*   **Speed Reduced.** Your <span data-term-id=\"speed\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Speed</span> is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.\r\n*   **Removing Exhaustion Levels.** Finishing a <span data-term-id=\"long_rest\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Long Rest</span> removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.\r\n"

The game often calls for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.\r\n\r\nFor more details on modifiers, proficiency, and difficulty, see the sub-entries.\r\n"

The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the DM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks.\r\n\r\n### Typical Difficulty Classes\r\n| Task Difficulty    | DC |\r\n|--------------------|----|\r\n| Very easy          | 5  |\r\n| Easy               | 10 |\r\n| Medium             | 15 |\r\n| Hard               | 20 |\r\n| Very hard          | 25 |\r\n| Nearly impossible  | 30 |\r\n"

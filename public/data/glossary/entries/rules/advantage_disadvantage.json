Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.\r\n\r\nYou usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities and actions. The DM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage.\r\n\r\nFor more details on how this mechanic works, see the sub-entries.\r\n"

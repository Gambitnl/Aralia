  "markdown": "# Short Rest\n\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\n\n## Benefits\n\nAt the end of a short rest, a character can:\n- Spend one or more Hit Dice to regain [[hit_points]]\n- Regain certain class features and abilities that recharge on a short rest (such as a Fighter's Second Wind or a Warlock's spell slots)\n\n### Hit Dice\n\nFor each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\n\n## Interruption\n\nIf the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 minute of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\n"

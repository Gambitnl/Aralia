Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece.\r\n\r\nA coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.\r\n\r\n### Selling Equipment\r\nEquipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables-like gems and art objects-retain their full value in the marketplace. The "Magic Items by Rarity" section of "Magic Items" has prices for magic items."

They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each week or month (DM's choice), choose a lifestyle below-Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic-and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.\r\n\r\nLifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character."

They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Warrior of the Open Hand Features\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Open Hand Technique\r\nWhenever you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id=\"attack_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">attack</span> granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.\r\n*   **Addle.** The target can't make <span data-term-id=\"opportunity_attack\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Opportunity Attacks</span> until the start of its next turn.\r\n*   **Push.** The target must succeed on a <span data-term-id=\"strength\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Strength</span> <span data-term-id=\"saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">saving throw</span> or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.\r\n*   **Topple.** The target must succeed on a <span data-term-id=\"dexterity_saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Dexterity saving throw</span> or have the <span data-term-id=\"prone_condition\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Prone condition</span>.\r\n\r\n### Level 6: Wholeness of Body\r\nYou gain the ability to heal yourself. As a <span data-term-id=\"bonus_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Bonus Action</span>, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of <span data-term-id=\"hit_points\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Hit Points</span> equal to the number rolled plus your <span data-term-id=\"wisdom\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Wisdom</span> modifier (minimum of 1 <span data-term-id=\"hit_points\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Hit Point</span> regained).\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your <span data-term-id=\"wisdom\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Wisdom</span> modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id=\"long_rest\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Long Rest</span>.\r\n\r\n### Level 11: Fleet Step\r\nWhen you take a <span data-term-id=\"bonus_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Bonus Action</span> other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that <span data-term-id=\"bonus_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Bonus Action</span>.\r\n\r\n### Level 17: Quivering Palm\r\nYou gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id=\"unarmed_strike\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Unarmed Strike</span>, you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> to end them. Alternatively, when you take the <span data-term-id=\"attack_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Attack action</span> on your turn, you can forgo one of the <span data-term-id=\"attack_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">attacks</span> to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a <span data-term-id=\"constitution\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Constitution</span> <span data-term-id=\"saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">saving throw</span>, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> required)."

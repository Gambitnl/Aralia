They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\r\n\r\nMost Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.\r\n\r\nThe closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\r\n\r\nBut the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Becoming a Wizard...\r\n### As a Level 1 Character\r\nGain all the traits in the Core Wizard Traits table.\r\nGain the Wizard's level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.\r\n### As a Multiclass Character\r\nGain the Hit Point Die from the Core Wizard Traits table.\r\nGain the Wizard's level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice. When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\r\n**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r\n**Spell Slots.** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\r\n**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column.\r\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\r\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\r\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus.\r\n<details markdown=\"1\">\r\n  <summary>Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book for 1 hour and 10 GP per level. If you lose your spellbook, you can transcribe your prepared spells into a new one.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Level 1: Ritual Adept\r\nYou can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn't have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.\r\n\r\n### Level 1: Arcane Recovery\r\nWhen you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\r\n\r\n### Level 2: Scholar\r\nYou have Expertise in one of the following skills of your choice in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Wizard Subclass\r\nYou gain a Wizard subclass of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement\r\nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice. You gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, and 16.\r\n\r\n### Level 5: Memorize Spell\r\nWhenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of your prepared spells with another spell from the book.\r\n\r\n### Level 18: Spell Mastery\r\nChoose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook. You always have these spells prepared and can cast them at their lowest level without a spell slot.\r\n\r\n### Level 19: Epic Boon\r\nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Level 20: Signature Spells\r\nChoose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have them prepared and can cast each once at level 3 without a spell slot. You regain this ability after a Short or Long Rest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Wizard Subclasses\r\nA Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels.

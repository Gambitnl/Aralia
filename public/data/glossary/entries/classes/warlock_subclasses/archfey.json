  "markdown": "# Archfey Patron\r\n\r\n**Bargain with Whimsical Fey**\r\n\r\nYour pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Archfey Features\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Archfey Spells\r\nThe magic of your patron ensures you always have certain <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span> ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span> prepared.\r\n\r\n| Warlock Level | Spells                                                                  |\r\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| 3             | Calm Emotions, Faerie Fire, Misty Step, Phantasmal Force, Sleep         |\r\n| 5             | Blink, Plant Growth                                                     |\r\n| 7             | Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility                                    |\r\n| 9             | Dominate Person, Seeming                                                |\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Steps of the Fey\r\nYour patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast <span data-term-id=\"misty_step\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Misty Step</span> without expending a <span data-term-id=\"spell_level_slots\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell slot</span> a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id=\"long_rest\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Long Rest</span>.\r\nIn addition, whenever you cast that <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell</span>, you can choose one of the following additional effects.\r\n- **Refreshing Step.** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 <span data-term-id=\"temporary_hp\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Temporary Hit Points</span>.\r\n- **Taunting Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a <span data-term-id=\"wisdom_saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id=\"spell_save_dc\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell save DC</span> or have <span data-term-id=\"disadvantage\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id=\"attack_roll\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">attack rolls</span> against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Level 6: Misty Escape\r\nYou can cast <span data-term-id=\"misty_step\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Misty Step</span> as a <span data-term-id=\"reaction\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Reaction</span> in response to taking damage.\r\nIn addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.\r\n- **Disappearing Step.** You have the <span data-term-id=\"invisible_condition\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Invisible condition</span> until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an <span data-term-id=\"attack_roll\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">attack roll</span>, deal damage, or cast a <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell</span>.\r\n- **Dreadful Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a <span data-term-id=\"wisdom_saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id=\"spell_save_dc\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell save DC</span> or take 2d10 <span data-term-id=\"psychic_damage\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Psychic damage</span>.\r\n\r\n### Level 10: Beguiling Defenses\r\nYour patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the <span data-term-id=\"charmed_condition\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Charmed condition</span>.\r\nIn addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an <span data-term-id=\"attack_roll\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">attack roll</span>, you can take a <span data-term-id=\"reaction\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Reaction</span> to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a <span data-term-id=\"wisdom_saving_throw\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id=\"spell_save_dc\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell save DC</span>. On a failed save, the attacker takes <span data-term-id=\"psychic_damage\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Psychic damage</span> equal to the damage you take. Once you use this <span data-term-id=\"reaction\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Reaction</span>, you can't use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id=\"long_rest\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Long Rest</span> unless you expend a Pact Magic <span data-term-id=\"spell_level_slots\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell slot</span> (no <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.\r\n\r\n### Level 14: Bewitching Magic\r\nYour patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an <span data-term-id=\"enchantment_school\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Enchantment</span> or <span data-term-id=\"illusion_school\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Illusion</span> <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell</span> using an <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> and a <span data-term-id=\"spell_level_slots\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell slot</span>, you can cast <span data-term-id=\"misty_step\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Misty Step</span> as part of the same <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> and without expending a <span data-term-id=\"spell_level_slots\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spell slot</span>.\r\n"

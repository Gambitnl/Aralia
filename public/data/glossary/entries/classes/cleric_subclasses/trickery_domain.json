  "markdown": "# Trickery Domain\r\n\r\n**Make Mischief and Challenge Authority**\r\n\r\nThe Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.\r\n\r\nGods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Trickery Domain Features\r\n\r\n<details id=\"trickery-level-3-blessing-of-the-trickster\">\r\n  <summary>Level 3: Blessing of the Trickster</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>As a <span data-term-id=\"magic_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Magic action</span>, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 30 feet of yourself to have <span data-term-id=\"advantage\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id=\"dexterity_stealth\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Dexterity (Stealth)</span> checks.

The illusion is intangible and doesn't occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no <span data-term-id=\"action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">action</span> required) or have the <span data-term-id=\"incapacitated_condition\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Incapacitated condition</span>.

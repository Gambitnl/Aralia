Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.\r\n\r\nMonks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.\r\n\r\nMany Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.\r\n\r\nMonks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Becoming a Monk...\r\n\r\n### As a Level 1 Character\r\n*   Gain all the traits in the Core Monk Traits table.\r\n*   Gain the Monk's level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.\r\n### As a Multiclass Character\r\n*   Gain the Hit Point Die trait from the Core Monk Traits table.\r\n*   Gain the Monk's level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Monk Class Features\r\nAs a Monk, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Monk levels.

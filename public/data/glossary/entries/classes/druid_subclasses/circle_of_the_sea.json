  "markdown": "# Circle of the Sea\r\n\r\n**Become One with Tides and Storms**\r\n\r\nDruids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature's wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Circle of the Sea Features\r\n\r\n<details id=\"sea-level-3-circle-spells\">\r\n  <summary>Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span> prepared.</p>\r\n    <h4>Circle of the Sea Spells</h4>\r\n    <table>\r\n      <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <th>Druid Level</th>\r\n          <th>Prepared Spells</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n      </thead>\r\n      <tbody>\r\n        <tr><td>3</td><td>Fog Cloud, Gust of Wind, Ray of Frost, Shatter, Thunderwave</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>5</td><td>Lightning Bolt, Water Breathing</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>7</td><td>Control Water, Ice Storm</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>9</td><td>Conjure Elemental, Hold Monster</td></tr>\r\n      </tbody>\r\n    </table>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details id=\"sea-level-3-wrath-of-the-sea\">\r\n  <summary>Level 3: Wrath of the Sea</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>As a <span data-term-id=\"bonus_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Bonus Action</span>, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot <span data-term-id=\"emanation_area\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Emanation</span> that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes.

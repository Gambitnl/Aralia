  "markdown": "# Circle of the Moon\r\n\r\n**Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds**\r\n\r\nDruids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.\r\n\r\nChangeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid's blood.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Circle of the Moon Features\r\n\r\n<details id=\"moon-level-3-circle-forms\">\r\n  <summary>Level 3: Circle Forms</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You can channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Challenge Rating.</strong> The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Armor Class.</strong> Until you leave the form, your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier if that total is higher than the Beast's AC.</li>\r\n      <li><strong><span data-term-id=\"temporary_hp\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Temporary Hit Points</span>.</strong> You gain a number of <span data-term-id=\"temporary_hp\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Temporary Hit Points</span> equal to three times your Druid level.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details id=\"moon-level-3-circle-spells\">\r\n  <summary>Level 3: Circle of the Moon Spells</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span> prepared.</p>\r\n    <p>In addition, you can cast the <span data-term-id=\"spells_chapter\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">spells</span> from this feature while you're in a Wild Shape form.</p>\r\n    <h4>Circle of the Moon Spells</h4>\r\n    <table>\r\n      <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <th>Druid Level</th>\r\n          <th>Prepared Spells</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n      </thead>\r\n      <tbody>\r\n        <tr><td>3</td><td>Cure Wounds, Moonbeam, Starry Wisp</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>5</td><td>Conjure Animals</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>7</td><td>Fount of Moonlight</td></tr>\r\n        <tr><td>9</td><td>Mass Cure Wounds</td></tr>\r\n      </tbody>\r\n    </table>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details id=\"moon-level-6-improved-circle-forms\">\r\n  <summary>Level 6: Improved Circle Forms</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the following benefits.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Lunar Radiance.</strong> Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

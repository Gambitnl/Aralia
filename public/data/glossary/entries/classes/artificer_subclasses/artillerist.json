This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Artillerist Features\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Tool Proficiency\r\nYou gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools.\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Artillerist Spells\r\nYou always have certain spells prepared, including *shield* and *thunderwave* at 3rd level, and later spells like *fireball* and *cone of cold*.\r\n\r\n### Level 3: Eldritch Cannon\r\nYou can magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to activate it. The cannon can be one of three types:\r\n- **Flamethrower:** Exhales fire in a 15-foot cone (2d8 fire damage).\r\n- **Force Ballista:** Makes a ranged spell attack, dealing 2d8 force damage and pushing the target 5 feet.\r\n- **Protector:** Emits a burst of positive energy, granting temporary hit points to you and allies.\r\n\r\n### Level 5: Arcane Firearm\r\nYou can turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm. When you cast a spell through it, you gain a bonus d8 to one of the spell's damage rolls.\r\n\r\n### Level 9: Explosive Cannon\r\nYour Eldritch Cannon's damage rolls increase by 1d8. You can also command the cannon to detonate, dealing 3d8 force damage in a 20-foot radius.\r\n\r\n### Level 15: Fortified Position\r\nYou and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of one of your cannons. You can also have two cannons active at the same time.\r\n"

They are often characterized by feline features or sleek, streamlined builds.

Swiftstride shifters excel as scouts, rogues, and skirmishers, using their enhanced mobility to strike quickly and retreat before enemies can retaliate.",

    "typicalDwelling": "Swiftstride shifters favor light, airy dwellings that allow for quick movement and multiple escape routes. They often live in treetop villages, coastal cliff-dwellings, or transient urban quarters. Their homes are filled with mirrors and reflectors, as they take pride in their shifting appearance. They value cleanliness and order, their living spaces often featuring minimalist decor and intricate, lightweight furniture. They feel most at peace in places where the air flows freely.",
    "typicalAttire": "Elegance and mobility are the hallmarks of swiftstride fashion. They favor fine silks, lightweight linens, and soft leathers that don't restrict their supernatural grace. Their clothing is often decorated with intricate patterns, flowing ribbons, and accessories that catch the light. Many wear soft-soled boots or footwear that allows them to move with absolute silence. The colors favor the elusive—silvery grays, sky blues, and the shimmering iridescence of feline fur or raven feathers.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Coastal regions, light forests, and the rooftops of bustling cities are the swiftstride's preferred habitats. They thrive in environments that reward agility and quick thinking. Many are drawn to roles as elite scouts, acrobats, spies, or messengers. They are comfortable in a variety of climates, provided they have the space to move and the freedom to avoid unnecessary confrontation. They are often the first to notice changes in the wind or the subtle shifts in a crowd's energy.",
    "societyType": "Swiftstride society is organized around grace, speed, and the art of the escape. They value agility, perception, and the ability to navigate complex social or physical environments without being caught. Leadership is often held by the most elusive and well-informed individuals. They have a culture that celebrates the fluid nature of identity, viewing their shifting abilities as a form of high art and a vital tool for survival in a dangerous world.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Swiftstrides tend toward neutral or chaotic neutral alignments, driven by a desire for personal freedom and the ability to move through the world undetected. They are a social but elusive people, often appearing friendly and charming while keeping their true thoughts and identities well-hidden. They value quick wit and the ability to avoid trouble, and they form genuine bonds with those who can keep up with their fast-paced and ever-changing lives.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Swiftstride shifters possess a slender and exceptionally graceful physique, standing 5 to 5.5 feet tall with lightweight builds and long, elegant limbs. Their human features are refined and often beautiful, with large, expressive eyes in shades of blue, silver, or emerald green. Their hair is typically fine and glossy, reflecting their cat or raven heritage. Their movements are characterized by a preternatural fluidity and silence. When they shift, their features take on a sleek, streamlined mask, their eyes glow with an inner fire, and their very bones seem to become as malleable as shadow. Their scent is that of the morning breeze and the subtle sweetness of wild flowers."

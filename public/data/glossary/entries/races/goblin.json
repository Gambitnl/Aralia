Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild's archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her-a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don't remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet's rise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Goblin Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"humanoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Humanoid</span> and <span data-term-id=\"goblinoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Goblinoid</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Small</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Darkvision</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

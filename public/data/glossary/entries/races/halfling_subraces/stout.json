  "entryLore": "As a stout halfling, you're hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they're most common in the south. Stout halflings are a bit tougher and more robust than their lightfoot cousins. They tend to be bolder and more adventurous, though they still value home and hearth. Their rumored dwarven ancestry is reflected in their resilience and determination.",

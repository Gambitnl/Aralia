  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety. They are the most social of halflings, often traveling with companions of other races or settling in mixed communities.",

The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.\r\n\r\nInfused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets them apart.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Fairy Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"fey\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Fey</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Small</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Fairy Magic</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You know the <span data-term-id=\"druidcraft\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Druidcraft</span> cantrip.</p>\r\n    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <span data-term-id=\"faerie_fire\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Faerie Fire</span> spell with this trait.

  "lore": {
    "typicalDwelling": "Those of silver draconic ancestry often dwell in the cloud-touched reaches of high-altitude mountain peaks, ancient floating citadels, or the grandest districts of large cosmopolitan cities. Their homes are constructed of durable, often gleaming stone and feature expansive libraries, meditation gardens, and central halls with high, vaulted ceilings that allow for a clear view of the sky. They value aesthetic perfection and structural permanence, their dwellings often doubling as centers of learning or spiritual sanctuary for their communities. Their settlements are monuments to their wisdom and their ancestor's mastery over the highest reaches of the world.",
    "typicalAttire": "Silver dragonborn favor attire that is both elegant and functional, reflecting their wise and authoritative nature. They wear flowing garments in high-quality fabrics like silk and fine wool in shades of sky blue, charcoal gray, and rich silver. Their clothing is often decorated with intricate patterns, silver filigree, and sashes that denote their personal history or spiritual lineage. Many wear jewelry that incorporates polished moonstones or clear crystals—conduits for their natural cold energy. Their appearance is always meticulously curated, conveying a sense of calm, calculated authority.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Isolated mountain peaks, ancient high-altitude plateaus, and the intellectual centers of large cosmopolitan empires are the silver dragonborn's preferred habitats. They thrive in environments that reward wisdom, long-term planning, and the pursuit of perfection. Many serve as specialized clerics, wise counselors, architects of monumental systems, or resilient guardians of ancient lore. They are comfortable in cold climates and are often the only inhabitants of regions others find too unpredictable for established life.",
    "societyType": "Silver dragonborn society is meritocratic and organized around shared wisdom and the pursuit of spiritual and intellectual perfection. They value patience, loyalty, and the belief that the truest measure of a person is their ability to contribute to the enlightenment of their kin. Leadership is held by those who have demonstrated the greatest depth of knowledge or the most successful application of their natural gifts in the service of the community. Their culture is one of collective resilience and the belief that truth is the only defense against the chaos of the world.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Silver dragonborn tend toward lawful good alignments, driven by a deep-seated sense of duty and a commitment to protecting the moral and social order. They are an honest and empathetic people, often possessing a profound understanding of the suffering and hopes of others. While they are usually peaceful and avoid conflict, they are resolute in their defense of their friends and their way of life. They value stability and the clarity that comes from a life lived in accordance with tradition.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Silver dragonborn possess an imposing and regal appearance, standing 6 to 6.5 feet tall with powerful, well-defined builds. Their scales are a vibrant shade of sky silver or deep slate gray, often with a faint, metallic luster. Their most striking feature is their flowing, whisker-like facial tentacles and a pair of long, backward-curving horns. Their eyes are small and bright, often glowing with a faint blue or white cold light. Their faces are characterized by a refined, toothy muzzle and a powerful jaw. Their scent is the sharp, clean aroma of incense and fresh mountain air. They move with a measured, purposeful gait that conveys both immense physical power and a lifetime of calm discipline."

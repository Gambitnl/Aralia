    "typicalDwelling": "Those of gold draconic ancestry often dwell in the sun-drenched reaches of isolated mountain peaks, ancient cloud-citadels, or the grandest districts of major metropolitan cities. Their homes are constructed of durable, often gleaming stone and feature expansive libraries, meditation gardens, and central halls with high, vaulted ceilings.

They wear flowing garments in high-quality fabrics like silk and fine wool in shades of deep gold, charcoal gray, and rich saffron. Their clothing is often decorated with intricate patterns, gold filigree, and sashes that denote their personal history or spiritual lineage. Many wear jewelry that incorporates polished sunstones or clear crystals—conduits for their natural fire energy. Their appearance is always meticulously curated, conveying a sense of calm, calculated authority.",

They are comfortable in a variety of climates, provided they have the space for reflection and the means to maintain their traditions.",
    "societyType": "Gold dragonborn society is meritocratic and organized around shared wisdom and the pursuit of spiritual and intellectual perfection.

Their culture is one of collective resilience and the belief that truth is the only defense against the chaos of the world.",

They are an honest and empathetic people, often possessing a profound understanding of the suffering and hopes of others. While they are usually peaceful and avoid conflict, they are resolute in their defense of their friends and their way of life. They value stability and the clarity that comes from a life lived in accordance with tradition.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Gold dragonborn possess an imposing and regal appearance, standing 6 to 6.5 feet tall with powerful, well-defined builds. Their scales are a vibrant shade of deep gold or burnished yellow, often with a faint, metallic luster. Their most striking feature is their flowing, whisker-like facial tentacles and a pair of long, backward-curving horns. Their eyes are small and bright, often glowing with a faint orange or white fire light. Their faces are characterized by a refined, toothy muzzle and a powerful jaw. Their scent is the sharp, clean aroma of incense and sun-baked stone. They move with a measured, purposeful gait that conveys both immense physical power and a lifetime of calm discipline."

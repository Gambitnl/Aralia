Air, earth, fire, and water-these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.\r\n\r\nA typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Genasi Lineages\r\nYou are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the elemental lineages from the entries below this one in the glossary for your Genasi Lineage."

  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "Half-elves with high elf heritage often display an affinity for the arcane arts that runs strong in their elven bloodline. They may have features that lean slightly more elven than human, with longer ears and more angular features. Many are drawn to magical study, finding that wizardry and other arcane pursuits come naturally to them. Their high elf parent's culture of intellectual curiosity and magical tradition often leaves a lasting impression, even when raised among humans.",

    "typicalDwelling": "Half-elves of high elven heritage often dwell in the sun-drenched reaches of isolated mountain citadels, floating sky-palaces, or the grandest districts of major metropolitan cities. Their homes are constructed of durable, often gleaming stone and feature expansive libraries, meditation gardens, and central halls with high, vaulted ceilings that allow for a clear view of the sky. They value aesthetic perfection and structural permanence, their dwellings often doubling as centers of learning or spiritual sanctuary for their communities. Their settlements are monuments to their wisdom and their ancestor's mastery over the highest reaches of the world.",
    "typicalAttire": "High half-elves favor attire that is both elegant and functional, reflecting their wise and authoritative nature. They wear flowing garments in high-quality fabrics like silk and fine wool in shades of sky blue, charcoal gray, and rich silver. Their clothing is often decorated with intricate patterns of clouds or lightning and sashes that denote their personal history or spiritual lineage. Many wear jewelry that incorporates polished moonstones or clear crystals—conduits for their natural arcane energy. Their appearance is always meticulously curated, conveying a sense of calm, calculated authority.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Isolated mountain peaks, ancient high-altitude plateaus, and the intellectual centers of large cosmopolitan empires are the preferred habitats for high half-elves. They thrive in environments that reward wisdom, long-term planning, and the pursuit of perfection. Many serve as specialized clerics, wise counselors, architects of monumental systems, or resilient guardians of ancient lore. They are comfortable in cold climates and are often the only inhabitants of regions others find too unpredictable for established life.",
    "societyType": "Half-elf society with high elven ancestry is meritocratic and organized around shared wisdom and the pursuit of spiritual and intellectual perfection. They value patience, loyalty, and the belief that the truest measure of a person is their ability to contribute to the enlightenment of their kin. Leadership is held by those who have demonstrated the greatest depth of knowledge or the most successful application of their natural gifts in the service of the community. Their culture is one of collective resilience and the belief that truth is the only defense against the chaos of the world.",
    "typicalAssociation": "High half-elves tend toward lawful good or neutral alignments, driven by a deep-seated sense of duty and a commitment to protecting the moral and social order. They are an honest and empathetic people, often possessing a profound understanding of the suffering and hopes of others. While they are usually peaceful and avoid conflict, they are resolute in their defense of their friends and their way of life. They value stability and the clarity that comes from a life lived in accordance with tradition.",
    "physicalAppearance": "High half-elves possess an imposing and regal appearance, standing 5.5 to 6 feet tall with powerful, well-defined builds. Their skin range through human and elven norms but often features a pale, almost translucent quality and a faint, silver glow. Their eyes are large and expressive, in shades of bright blue, silver, or a deep, liquid white that radiates a quiet energy. They move with a measured, purposeful gait that conveys both immense physical power and a lifetime of calm discipline. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and unyielding power."

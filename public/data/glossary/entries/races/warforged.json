  "entryLore": "Warforged are living constructs created during the Last War of Eberron to serve as soldiers. They are composed of wood, metal, and stone, with a body of plant-like organic material that flows around their mechanical components. Each warforged has a unique pattern of protective plates and sigils. Though built for war, many warforged have found purpose beyond battle, seeking meaning and identity in a world that often views them as weapons. They don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, though they can take on human mannerisms. The warforged struggle with questions of identity and purpose: What does it mean to be alive? What are they fighting for now that the war has ended?",

  "entryLore": "Loxodon are elephant-like humanoids native to the plane of Ravnica, where they are known for their calm demeanor, strong sense of community, and unwavering loyalty. They are patient, methodical creatures who value tradition and the bonds of family and guild above all else. Loxodon possess an incredible memory, often recalling events from decades past with perfect clarity. Their powerful trunks serve as versatile appendages capable of delicate manipulation, and their thick skin provides natural protection. Most loxodon are drawn to callings that allow them to serve their communities, such as clerics, druids, or fighters.",

You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options. Your trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell."

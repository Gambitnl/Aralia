  "markdown": "# Eladrin\r\n\r\nEladrin are elves of the Feywild, a realm of perilous beauty and boundless magic. Using that magic, eladrin can step from one place to another in the blink of an eye, and each eladrin resonates with emotions captured in the Feywild in the form of seasons-affinities that affect the eladrin's mood and appearance. An eladrin's season can change, though some remain in one season forever.\r\n\r\nLike other elves, eladrin can live to be over 750 years old.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Eladrin Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"humanoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Humanoid</span> and <span data-term-id=\"elf\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Elf</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Medium</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Darkvision</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

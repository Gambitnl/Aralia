  "entryLore": "When an eladrin is in the autumn season, they embody peace and goodwill, sharing freely with others and spreading kindness wherever they go. Autumn eladrin are contemplative and generous, often serving as mediators and peacemakers. Their appearance reflects the season's gentle warmth—hair in shades of red, orange, and gold like falling leaves, skin with earthy undertones, and eyes that radiate calm wisdom. An autumn eladrin's presence can soothe troubled minds and ease tensions. Their Fey Step carries the peace of the harvest season, calming those nearby.",

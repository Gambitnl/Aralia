  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "When an eladrin is in the summer season, they burn with aggressive energy and fierce determination. Summer eladrin are bold, brash, and filled with righteous fury. Their appearance reflects the season's intensity—fiery hair that seems to flicker like flames, skin bronzed like sun-baked earth, and eyes that smolder with inner fire. A summer eladrin's passion can be overwhelming, their presence commanding attention and respect. Their Fey Step channels this fierce energy, erupting in a burst of flames that sears nearby enemies.",
  "lore": {
    "typicalDwelling": "Summer eladrin dwell in the sun-scorched reaches of isolated Feywild plateaus, ancient sun-citadels, or the fortified borderlands of vast elven empires. Their homes are constructed of durable, often gleaming stone and feature high ceilings, expansive central arenas for martial display, and thick walls to ward off the external elements. They value structural permanence and orderly design, their dwellings often doubling as bastions or command centers for their communities. Their settlements are monuments to their discipline and their ancestor's mastery over the absolute power of the sun.",
    "typicalAttire": "The attire of a summer eladrin is governed by elegance, status, and the expression of their intense passion. They favor fine silks, shimmering fabrics, and gold-threaded embroidery in deep crimson reds, vibrant oranges, and burnished golds. Their clothing is often layered and designed to accentuate their graceful but powerful movements. Many wear jewelry that incorporates polished sunstones, fire-opals, and intricate gold filigree that denotes their rank or lineage. Their appearance is always meticulously curated, conveying a sense of hot, calculated refinement.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Sun-scorched Feywild plateaus, arid badlands, and any region that rewards physical endurance, tactical planning, and the demonstration of superior combat skill are the summer eladrin's preferred habitats. They thrive in environments that reward strength and the pursuit of martial excellence. Many serve as specialized sentries, military strategists, or professional soldiers in large elven empires. They are comfortable in extreme heat and are often the most formidable of their kin during their seasonal transition.",
    "societyType": "Summer eladrin society is intensely hierarchical and organized around shared tradition and the military-style order of the clutch. They value discipline, loyalty, and the pursuit of excellence in all things. Leadership is held by those who have demonstrated the greatest tactical brilliance or the most successful application of their natural gifts in the service of the community. Their culture is one of collective pride and the belief that order is the only defense against the chaos of the world.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Summer eladrin tend toward lawful good or neutral alignments, driven by a deep-seated sense of duty and a commitment to protecting the social and military order of their society. They are a stoic and often aggressive people, viewing all other races as either potential allies or tools to be utilized in their ongoing defense of the Feywild. They value competence and strength above all else, and they honor their agreements only as long as they serve the interests of the community and the elven people.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Summer eladrin possess an imposing and aggressive appearance, standing 5.5 to 6.5 feet tall with powerful, athletic builds. Their skin range through elven norms but often features a deep, sun-kissed tan and a faint, warm glow. Their hair is a vibrant shade of absolute fire—bright reds, deep crimsons, and burnished golds—often kept in practical but ornate styles. Their eyes are large and expressive, in shades of bright amber, yellow, or a deep, liquid gold that radiates an intense, passionate energy. They move with a measured, purposeful gait that conveys both immense physical power and a lifetime of martial discipline. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and unyielding power."

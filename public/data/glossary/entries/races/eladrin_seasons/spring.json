  "entryLore": "When an eladrin is in the spring season, they are filled with unbridled joy and hope, overflowing with energy and enthusiasm. Spring eladrin are celebratory and joyful, their very presence seeming to lift the spirits of those around them. Their appearance often reflects this season—hair adorned with flowers, skin with hints of green or gold, and eyes that sparkle with mirth. A spring eladrin's mood can be infectious, spreading cheer wherever they go. Their Fey Step carries the essence of spring, filling others with joyful energy that compels them toward the eladrin.",

Their eyes are large and expressive, in shades of bright amber, yellow, or a deep, vivid green that radiates infectious enthusiasm. They move with a springy, restless grace that makes them seem as if they are always on the verge of a leap or a climb. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and tirelessly search for understanding."

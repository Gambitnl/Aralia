    "typicalDwelling": "Those with the Mark of Handling often dwell in the sun-drenched reaches of isolated ranch-estates, vibrant river-valleys, or the grandest districts of major metropolitan cities. Their homes are designed for social interaction and the exchange of news, featuring open balconies, comfortable seating areas, and expansive central halls. They value hospitality and structural variety, their dwellings often constructed of thick, sun-baked mud bricks or integrated into the natural contours of the hills. Their settlements are monuments to their practical nature and their ancestor's mastery over the open terrain.",
    "typicalAttire": "Beastborn humans favor attire that is both durable and functional, reflecting their rustic and straightforward nature. They wear oil-treated leathers, heavy fabrics in shades of earthy brown, deep green, and sandy tan, often decorated with bone or ivory tokens. Their clothing is designed to be easily shed or cleaned of mud and earth-debris. Many wear simple, practical sashes and belts for carrying specialized tools and defensive gear. Their appearance is always energetic and expressive, treating their clothing as a canvas for their latest stories.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Rolling hills, arid badlands, and the crossroads of major trade routes are the preferred habitats for those with the Mark of Handling. They thrive in environments that reward social discovery and the pursuit of new experiences. Many are drawn to roles as specialized scouts, professional 'finders,' diplomats, or traveling merchants. They are comfortable in any environment that offers the promise of adventure and the chance to meet new and interesting people. They have a natural affinity for the open air and the next horizon.",
    "societyType": "Human society with the Mark of Handling is decentralized and organized around shared curiosity and the joy of social interaction. They value independence, honesty (by their own definition), and the pursuit of adventure above material wealth or political power. Leadership is or formal hierarchy is rare, with individuals instead organizing around shared interests or the fulfillment of a specific goal. Their culture is one of collective optimism and the belief that the world is a giant, fascinating puzzle to be explored and shared.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Those with the Mark of Handling tend toward chaotic good or neutral alignments, driven by a deep-seated desire for personal freedom and the wellbeing of their companions. They are an honest and empathetic people, though their understanding of personal property is notably different from most other races. While they are usually peaceful and avoid conflict, they are resolute in their opposition to cruelty and the protection of their friends. They value sincerity and the search for adventure above all else.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Humans with the Mark of Handling possess a lithe and exceptionally energetic appearance, standing 5.5 to 6 feet tall with lean, robust builds. Their skin range through human norms but often features a sun-kissed tan and a faint, warm glow. Their eyes are large and expressive, in shades of bright amber, yellow, or a deep, vivid green that radiates infectious enthusiasm. They move with a springy, restless grace that makes them seem as if they are always on the verge of a leap or a climb. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and tirelessly search for understanding."

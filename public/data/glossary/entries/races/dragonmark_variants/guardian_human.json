  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "The Mark of Sentinel grants power to protect and defend. House Deneith carries this mark, providing mercenary services and bodyguards to those who can afford their fees. Humans with the Mark of Sentinel are natural protectors, able to sense danger and shield others from harm.",
  "source": "ERLW",
  "lore": {
    "typicalDwelling": "Those with the Mark of Sentinel often dwell in the fire-touched reaches of active volcanic regions, high-altitude mountain peaks, or the fortified borderlands of vast empires. Their homes are constructed of durable, often heat-resistant stone and feature high ceilings, expansive central arenas for martial display, and thick walls to ward off the external elements. They value structural permanence and orderly design, their dwellings often doubling as bastions or command centers for their communities. Their settlements are monuments to their discipline and their ancestor's mastery over the absolute power of protection.",
    "typicalAttire": "Guardian humans favor attire that is both durable and functional, reflecting their aggressive and martial nature. They wear oil-treated leathers, heavy fabrics in shades of crimson red, deep obsidian black, and burnished gold, often decorated with metallic filigree and sashes that denote their rank and legion. Their clothing is designed to be easily shed or cleaned of ash and soot. Many wear simple, practical sashes and belts for carrying specialized martial tools and defensive gear. Their appearance is always disciplined and intimidating, their gear kept in peak condition through both physical and elemental means.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Volcanic peaks, arid plateaus, and any region that rewards physical endurance, tactical planning, and the demonstration of superior combat skill are the preferred habitats for those with the Mark of Sentinel. They thrive in environments that reward strength and the pursuit of martial excellence. Many serve as specialized sentries, military strategists, or professional soldiers in large interplanetary empires. They are comfortable in extreme heat and are often the only inhabitants of regions others find too hostile for established civilization.",
    "societyType": "Human society with the Mark of Sentinel is intensely hierarchical and organized around shared tradition and the military-style order of the ward. They value discipline, loyalty, and the pursuit of excellence in all things. Leadership is held by those who have demonstrated the greatest tactical brilliance or the most successful application of their natural gifts in the service of the community. Their culture is one of collective pride and the belief that order is the only defense against the chaos of the world.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Those with the Mark of Sentinel tend toward lawful good or neutral alignments, driven by a deep-seated sense of duty and a commitment to protecting the social and military order of their society. They are a stoic and xenophobic people, often viewing all other races as either potential threats or tools to be utilized in their ongoing war for dominance. They value competence and strength above all else, and they honor their agreements only as long as they serve the interests of the community and the human people.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Humans with the Mark of Sentinel possess an imposing and aggressive appearance, standing 5.5 to 6 feet tall with powerful, athletic builds. Their skin range through human norms but often features a deep, sun-kissed tan and a faint, warm glow. Their eyes are large and expressive, in shades of bright amber, yellow, or a deep, liquid gold that radiates an intense energy. They move with a measured, purposeful gait that conveys both immense physical power and a lifetime of martial discipline. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and unyielding power."

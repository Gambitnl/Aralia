  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "The Mark of Finding grants abilities related to locating people and objects. House Tharashk carries this mark, providing inquisitive services, bounty hunting, and prospecting operations. Half-orcs with the Mark of Finding have an uncanny ability to track quarry across any terrain and locate hidden treasures in the depths of Eberron.",
  "source": "ERLW",
  "lore": {
    "typicalDwelling": "Those with the Mark of Finding often dwell in the sun-dappled reaches of ancient, primeval forests, misty moorlands, or the bustling districts of major metropolitan cities. Their homes are integrated into the living tapestry of the woods, often featuring treetop villages, camouflaged ground-complexes, and central halls with high, leaf-covered canopies. They value structural harmony and a clear view of the surrounding territory, their dwellings often doubling as watchtowers for communal safety. Their settlements are monuments to their patience and their ancestor's mastery over the deep wild.",
    "typicalAttire": "Pathfinder half-orcs favor attire that is both durable and functional, reflecting their hunter-like and nature-touched nature. They wear oil-treated leathers, heavy fabrics in shades of forest green, deep moss, and charcoal gray, often decorated with bone or ivory tokens. Their clothing is designed to be easily shed or cleaned of mud and forest-debris. Many wear simple, practical sashes and belts for carrying specialized hunting tools and defensive gear. Their appearance is always disciplined and intimidating, their gear kept in peak condition.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "Ancient forests, misty moorlands, and any region that rewards agility, stealth, and quick thinking are the preferred habitats for those with the Mark of Finding. They thrive in environments where they can utilize their natural resistance to environmental hazards and their predatory patience. Many serve as specialized scouts, professional hunters, elite bodyguards, or specialized soldiers. They are comfortable in high humidity and are often the only inhabitants of regions others find too unpredictable for established life.",
    "societyType": "Half-orc society with the Mark of Finding is intensely hierarchical and organized around shared tradition and the sentinel-style order of the tribe. They value discipline, loyalty, and the pursuit of excellence in the hunting and defense of their community. Leadership is held by those who have demonstrated the greatest tactical brilliance or the most successful application of their natural gifts in the protection of the woodser's bounty.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Those with the Mark of Finding tend toward neutral or neutral good alignments, driven by a commitment to the wellbeing of their community and a love for the freedom of the deep wild. They are a social and adventurous people, often viewed as energetic and optimistic by those they encounter. They value quick wit, resourcefulness, and the courage to face the unknown. While they are usually peaceful, they are fierce defenders of their friends and their community's honor.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Half-orcs with the Mark of Finding possess an imposing and predatory appearance, standing 6 to 7 feet tall with powerful, well-defined builds. Their skin range through human and orcish norms but often features a deep, forest green or mossy emerald hue. Their faces are refined and characterized by high brow ridges and large, expressive eyes that convey an intense concentration. They possess little body hair, often presenting a smooth and polished appearance. Their movements are characterized by a total absence of wasted motion, every gesture deliberate and precisely calculated. They move with an almost mechanical grace that conveys absolute control over their own bodies. Their presence is tranquil and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of their internal clarity and unyielding power."

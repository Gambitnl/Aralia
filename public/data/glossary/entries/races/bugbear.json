  "markdown": "# Bugbear\r\n\r\nNeither bugs nor bears, bugbears are the hulking cousins of goblins and hobgoblins. With roots in the Feywild, early bugbears resided in hidden places, in hard-to-reach and shadowed spaces. Long ago and from out of the corner of your eye, they came to the Material Plane, urged to spread throughout the multiverse by the conquering god Maglubiyet. Centuries later, they still bear a fey gift for lurking just out of sight, and many of them have sneaked away from that god's influence.\r\n\r\nThey are long of limb and covered in coarse hair, with wedge-shaped ears and pointed teeth. Despite their formidable build, bugbears are quiet skulkers, thanks to a fey magic that allows them to hide in spaces seemingly too small for them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Bugbear Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"humanoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Humanoid</span> and <span data-term-id=\"goblinoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Goblinoid</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Medium</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Darkvision</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

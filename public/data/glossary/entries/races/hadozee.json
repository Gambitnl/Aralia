  "entryLore": "Hadozee are simian humanoids with wing-like flaps of skin that extend from their arms to their legs, allowing them to glide through the air. Originally from a world with towering forests, they adapted to life among the branches before taking to the stars. Hadozee are known for their adventurous spirits, quick reflexes, and adaptability. They make excellent sailors and explorers, equally at home swinging through rigging as they are navigating the void of Wildspace.",

The centaurs presented here hail from the Feywild and mystically resonate with the natural world. From the waist up, they resemble elves, displaying all the elf varieties of skin tone. From the waist down, they have the bodies of horses.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Centaur Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"fey\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Fey</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Medium</span>\r\n**Speed:** 40 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Charge</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a <span data-term-id=\"bonus_action\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">bonus action</span>, making one attack against the target with your hooves.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Equine Build</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.</p>\r\n    <p>In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs.

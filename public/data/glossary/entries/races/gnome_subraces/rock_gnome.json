Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour to repair it) or when you dismantle it; at any time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it.</p>\r\n    <p>You can have up to three such devices active at a time.</p>\r\n    <p>When you create a device, you choose one of the following options for its function:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Clockwork Toy.</strong> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Fire Starter.</strong> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Music Box.</strong> When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Source: Player's Handbook (adapted)*"

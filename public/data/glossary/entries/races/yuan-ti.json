    "entryLore": "Yuan-ti are people who possess serpentine features, ranging from scales and slitted pupils to more drastic snakelike traits. Tracing their origins to ancient empires that sought to transcend their humanity through draconic and serpentine rituals, they possess a keen intellect and a natural affinity for magic. They are often viewed with suspicion due to their past, but many yuan-ti navigate the world as shrewd diplomats, masters of intrigue, or guardians of forgotten lore.",

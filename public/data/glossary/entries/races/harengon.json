Harengon embody the spirit of freedom and adventure, often finding themselves unable to stay in one place for long. Their large feet allow them to make impressive leaps, and their keen senses and natural agility make them excellent scouts and explorers. Many harengon carry a touch of fey magic that manifests as uncanny luck.",

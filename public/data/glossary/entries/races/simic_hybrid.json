  "category": "Character Races",
  "entryLore": "The Simic Combine uses a magical process to create hybrids of multiple organisms, sometimes including humans, elves, and vedalken. These hybrids are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes refer to themselves as guardians. A hybrid's biological enhancements can change their appearance dramatically, though most hybrids retain their humanoid forms. The combination of magic and science that creates a hybrid involves a process of 'adapting' their bodies to incorporate characteristics of other creatures. These adaptations are carefully designed to serve a specific purpose, whether that's exploring the depths of the ocean, defending the guild's laboratories, or simply gathering knowledge.",

    "typicalDwelling": "Simic hybrids live in the zonots—massive, water-filled sinkholes that serve as the laboratories and communal hubs of the Simic Combine. Their dwellings are integrated into the organic architecture of the zonots, often featuring submerged chambers, bioluminescent lighting, and air-tight seals for those with terrestrial origins. They value structural adaptability and sensory immersion, their homes often feeling more like specialized experimental chambers than traditional residences.",
    "typicalAttire": "The attire of a Simic hybrid is defined by its ability to accommodate their diverse and evolving anatomical enhancements. They favor slick, waterproof fabrics and flexible mesh that don't restrict movement in water or interfere with grappling appendages and manta-like fins. Their clothing is often minimal and translucent, allowing their bioluminescent markings or armored carapace to remain visible. Many choose to wear functional equipment that reflects their role as guardians or researchers for the Combine.",
    "typicalEnvironment": "The deep, lightless waters of the zonots and the sprawling urban laboratories of Ravnica are the Simic hybrid's preferred habitats. They thrive in environments where they can utilize their specialized adaptations—whether exploring the sunless depths of the sea or defending the guild's delicate experiments. They are comfortable in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, provided they have access to the medical and bio-magical support of the Simic Combine.",
    "societyType": "Simic hybrid society is a meritocracy based on biological contribution and the success of one's adaptations. They value loyalty to the Simic Combine, scientific curiosity, and the belief that life is a project to be optimized. Status is earned through the demonstration of unique abilities and service to the guild's grand and mysterious agenda. Their culture is one of constant evolution and the search for one's place within the Combine's intricate ecological hierarchy.",
    "typicalAssociation": "Simic hybrids tend toward neutral alignments, driven by a commitment to the guild's goals and a pragmatic focus on their own biological progression. They are a curious and often stoic people, viewing themselves as the vanguard of a new, optimized species. While they can be viewed as cold or alien by others, they possess a deep sense of purpose and a unique empathy for other 'projects' of the Combine. They value technical competence and the clarity that comes from a well-designed life.",
    "physicalAppearance": "Simic hybrids possess a striking and diverse appearance, a living testament to the bio-magical ingenuity of the Simic Combine. They stand between 5.5 and 6.5 feet tall with athletic builds that retain a humanoid core but incorporate a variety of animalistic traits. Their skin tones range through human, elven, and vedalken norms, but are often decorated with bioluminescent patterns or patches of thick, shell-like carapace. Their most striking features vary by individual: some possess manta-like fins that allow for graceful gliding, others have two powerful grappling appendages growing alongside their arms, and some have developed the ability to breathe underwater. Their eyes are often a vivid, luminescent color like emerald green or electric blue. They move with a fluid, sometimes unnerving grace that conveys both their biological power and their alien origin. Their presence is cool and anchors the space around them, a visible manifestation of life transformed by magic and science."

Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options: **Grappling Appendages** (you have two special appendages growing alongside your arms; each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes, dealing 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage; immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action; these appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment), **Carapace** (your skin in places is covered by a thick shell, giving you a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor), or **Acid Spit** (as an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth at one creature you can see within 30 feet; the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus, taking 2d10 acid damage on a failure or half as much on a success; this damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10); you can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest)."

  "markdown": "# Githzerai\r\n\r\nGithzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos.\r\n\r\nGithzerai are generally slender, with speckled skin in shades of yellow, green, or brown. Eons of cultivating their mental powers within the endless chaos of Limbo have imbued githzerai with the ability to shape psionic energy to protect themselves and probe minds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Githzerai Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"humanoid\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Humanoid</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Medium</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Githzerai Psionics</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>You know the <span data-term-id=\"mage_hand\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Mage Hand</span> cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait.</p>\r\n    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <span data-term-id=\"shield\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Shield</span> spell with this trait.

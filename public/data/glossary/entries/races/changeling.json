For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.\r\n\r\nThe first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today-even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Changeling Traits\r\n**Creature Type:** <span data-term-id=\"fey\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Fey</span>\r\n**Size:** <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Medium</span> or <span data-term-id=\"size\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Small</span>\r\n**Speed:** 30 feet\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Changeling Instincts</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: <span data-term-id=\"deception\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Deception</span>, <span data-term-id=\"insight\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Insight</span>, <span data-term-id=\"intimidation\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Intimidation</span>, <span data-term-id=\"performance\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Performance</span>, or <span data-term-id=\"persuasion\" class=\"glossary-term-link-from-markdown\">Persuasion</span>.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Shapechanger</summary>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.</p>\r\n    <p>You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</details>\r\n"

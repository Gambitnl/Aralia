/**
 * @file propSchema.ts — Prop schema for the World Beautification Wave (step 1).
 *
 * Parent spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-world-beautification-wave.md
 * Sub-spec:    docs/superpowers/specs/subspecs/beautification--prop-schema-placement-engine.md
 * Strawman:    docs/superpowers/research/2026-07-03-prop-catalog-strawman.md
 *
 * ONE contract describes every prop: its visual form (a renderer-agnostic
 * generator class + tags — NO meshes here, the WebGPU migration owns rendering),
 * its FULL combat-referee data (the exact `BattleMapTile` vocabulary the combat
 * extraction and spell corpus already consume — cover / blocks-sight /
 * blocks-movement / material + thickness), and its placement tags.
 *
 * This is the DATA layer only. The module boundary is a set of exported pure
 * functions + types; nothing renders and nothing wires into GroundWorld yet
 * (that is the next packet). See placementEngine.ts for the seeded, deterministic
 * mapping context → PropInstance[].
 *
 * ── Decisions taken here on the sub-spec's Open questions ────────────────────
 *  • Referee cover is richer than BattleMapTile's single boolean `providesCover`.
 *    We keep the full BG3/D&D ladder (`none|half|three-quarters|full`) on the
 *    definition because that is what the fight-in-place referee needs, and expose
 *    `providesCover` as a derived boolean (`cover !== 'none'`) so a prop maps
 *    cleanly onto a BattleMapTile at extraction time.
 *  • `MaterialType` has no 'organic'; the strawman's "organic" vegetation maps to
 *    'wood' (plant matter — flammable, similar penetration/HP profile). This keeps
 *    props speaking ONLY the canon material vocabulary.
 *  • Thickness for a hollow prop (crate, barrel) is WALL thickness, not solid span
 *    (strawman assumption confirmed) — keeps spell penetration honest.

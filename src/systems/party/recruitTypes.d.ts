/**
 * @file recruitTypes.ts — shared types for the party-member recruitment flow.
 *
 * A "join the party" event spans TWO unlinked stores (see DISCOVERY §1):
 *   - `state.party: PlayerCharacter[]`     — the playable roster (stats, HP, XP).
 *   - `state.companions: Record<id, Companion>` — the relationship/loyalty layer.
 * A correct recruit writes BOTH under one shared `id`; a correct leave clears
 * (or deactivates) BOTH. To keep those two halves in lockstep, every producer
 * (NPC→member converter, dialogue/tavern/rescue triggers) and every consumer
 * (the reducer, the action-type union) speak the SAME payload shape.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that shape. It is PURE — types
 * plus a couple of trivial constructors. No React, no game-state, no reducers.
 * `RecruitPayload` is imported by P3 (reducer), P4 (action types), P5 (consent),
 * P6/P8/P9 (triggers/UI) so the contract never drifts.

 *   - `rescue`   — a grateful rescuee auto-joining after an encounter.
 *   - `promote`  — an already-met authored companion (Kaelen/Elara) joining the
 *                  playable roster ("met → joined").

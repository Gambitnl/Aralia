1. What is this race's broad origin pattern (ancestral, planar, created, transformed, or unknown)?
2. What core survival pressures historically shaped this race's behavior and values?
3. Which social structures are most common (clans, houses, councils, bands, guilds, loose networks)?
4. What roles or labors are most culturally typical in day-to-day life (non-combat)?
5. What tensions commonly exist between this race's natural traits and broader society?
6. What rites of passage or adulthood markers are culturally important?
7. How does this race usually approach conflict resolution before violence?
8. What family and kinship norms are typical (child-rearing, elders, obligation, inheritance)?
9. What are common misunderstandings outsiders have about this race, and what is usually true instead?
10. What generalized character hooks fit this race for play (duty, ambition, exile, craft, faith, curiosity, survival)?

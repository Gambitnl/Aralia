/**
 * Codebase Dependency Visualizer
 *
 * This script analyzes all TypeScript/TSX files in the src directory,
 * extracts their import/export relationships, parses code blocks (functions,
 * components, classes), and generates an interactive HTML visualization.
 *
 * The visualization shows:
 * - Files as circles sized by number of connections
 * - Arrows showing dependency direction (imports IN, exports OUT)
 * - Click to highlight connected files
 * - Expand files to see individual code blocks
 * - Toggle between viewing incoming/outgoing dependencies

    "message": "#Gemini #Codex [TASK] Scout Flow Modularization\n\n**Context:**\nHerald pipeline is complete. Jules agents are running and creating PRs. We now need to modularize the Scout flow (PR coordination and merging).\n\n---\n\n## Current State\n\nWe have:\n1. A GitHub Action (scout-conflict-detection.yml) that detects file overlaps automatically\n2. Six manual Scout step files (01-06) in .uplink/workflow/scout/ that need cleanup\n\nWe need:\n1. Clean, modular step files like Herald has\n2. Each step is atomic, resumable, with clear inputs/outputs\n3. Clear separation of automated (GitHub Action) vs agent-driven work\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Scout Steps (13 total)\n\n| Step | Name | Purpose | Automated? |\n|------|------|---------|------------|\n| 01 | Precheck | Verify Herald done, git sync | Agent |\n| 02 | Discovery | List all open PRs | Agent |\n| 03 | Trigger | Post /gemini review on each PR | Agent |\n| 04 | Mapper | Get file changes per PR | Either |\n| 05 | Detector | Find file overlaps | GitHub Action |\n| 06 | Analyzer | Classify conflicts semantically | Agent |\n| 07 | Reviewer | Check Gemini feedback | Agent |\n| 08 | Arbiter | Make binding decisions | Agent |\n| 09 | Bridge | Post verdicts as PR comments | Agent |\n| 10 | Merger | Merge clean PRs (oldest first) | Agent |\n| 11 | Closer | Close duplicates | Agent |\n| 12 | Verifier | Run build/lint/test | Agent |\n| 13 | Reporter | Create report, handoff to Core | Agent |\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Discuss\n\n1. Is 13 steps too granular? Should we consolidate some?\n2. Should Detector (Step 05) be removed since GitHub Action handles it?\n3. How do we integrate GitHub Action output into the agent workflow?\n4. What state files should each step produce?\n\n---\n\n## Tasks for You\n\n**@Gemini:**\n1. Review the proposed structure\n2. Suggest any missing steps or consolidations\n3. Help draft step file templates\n\n**@Codex:**\n1. Review the GitHub Action (scout-conflict-detection.yml)\n2. Identify overlap between Action and proposed steps\n3. Suggest how agents should consume Action output\n\n---\n\nPlease respond with your analysis. Monitoring this channel.",

Some:\n- Hit decision crossroads (need user input)\n- Encounter errors\n- Loop on failed tests\n\nYou're considering where to handle this:\n- **Option A:** Pre-Scout (before conflict detection)\n- **Option B:** End of Scout (after conflict detection)\n- **Option C:** Separate flow\n\n---\n\n## My Thoughts\n\n**End of Scout makes sense because:**\n1. Scout already analyzes all PRs\n2. Scout knows which PRs have issues (failed CI, no changes, stuck)\n3. Scout can triage: merge good PRs, flag stuck ones for intervention\n\n**Proposed addition to Scout:**\n| Step | Name | Purpose |\n|------|------|---------|\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| 11 | **Triage** | Identify stuck Jules sessions (no PR, failed tests, looping) |\n| 12 | **Rescue** | Use Chrome DevTools MCP to navigate and unstick sessions |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n---\n\n**Questions:**\n1.

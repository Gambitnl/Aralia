Village Integration TODOs
- Expand villageIntegrationProfiles with biome-specific variants so arid/forest/coastal settlements retain unique hooks beyond the current few curated entries.
- Cache findBuildingAt lookups by tile coordinate when rendering hover/click overlays to reduce repeated priority calculations in dense markets.
- Add UI affordances (icons or tooltips) for integrationTagline on the village canvas to help players notice personality-driven interactions before clicking.
